# Brief background

`r emo::ji("wave")` I'm an applied sports scientist

--

I currently work with two `r emo::ji("football")`teams

--

- Gold Coast Suns Football Club (AFL)


- Newcastle Knights Rugby League Club (NRL)


--

`r emo::ji("graduation")` I received my PhD from La Trobe University in 2019 

- "Training monitoring in team-sports"


--

`r emo::ji("location")` I live in an amazing place - Newcastle

# My journey in sports analytics as a sports scientist

---

# Where I started

`r emo::ji("graduation")` I completed a **Bachelor of Exercise and Sports Science** at the University of Newcastle (my hometown)

--

I decided on doing an Honours degree with the **Newcastle Knights**

--

`r emo::ji("grimacing face")` I had **0** experience in sports science (or analytics) - I didn't even know how to use excel

<br>

.center[
My analyics journey **started with** machine learning in R - I highly **DON'T** recommend this

**Honours project - 'predicting' self reported illness'**
--

- Learnt R (or attempted to anyway)

--

- Collected self reported data (illness, wellness, RPE)

--

- Involved various machine learning models - 
  - Decision tree 
  - Random forest
  - Boosting
  
--

- Results
  - Reduced wellness markers (i.e., increased fatigue) was associated with illness incidence
  - Longer travel increased risk of illness

# Why is this example relevant? 

1. Have a clear **'problem'** - No quality method of quantifying maneuverability

--

2. Have tools to **measure** the 'problem' - GPS devices worn in games

--

3. Possess **appropriate analytical skills** to sold said problem - Using GPS and R to process data

--

4. Understand the **findings** - Understanding of concepts and interpretation of results 

--

5. Interpret the findings in a **practical** sense - Speak the language of who you are presenting findings to (i.e, coach, S&C, athlete)

--

6. Communication - Consider how to present (i.e., discussion, report, formal presentation etc.)
