# Why did I learn to work with data?

.pull-left[- During my Honours, I struggled to have an impact on the sports science staff as I had **little to no skills**]
--
.pull-left[- I had completed an **Bachelor of Exercise and Sport Science**, however lacked the knowledge that would help me in this applied setting]
--
.pull-left[- I experienced my fair share of gender-related issues in this setting, "you've never played football, so what would you know"]
--
.pull-left[- I started to notice that there was a bit of a knowledge gap/opportunity for some data-related expertise (although I had none)]
--
.pull-left[- My initial project fell to pieces and I was left with no project about 4 months in `r emo::ji("grimacing face")`]

# What next?

.center[

]

My data analyics journey **started with** machine learning in R as an Honours student - I highly **DON'T** recommend this
